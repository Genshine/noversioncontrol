### Why Viz?

Viewing raw stats and tables only tell you **part of a story**.

`Viz` helps tell the rest of the story with **interactive visualizations** that are **continually updated**.

### How Do We Help or Stay Up-To-Date With the Evolution of Viz?

`Viz` is just getting started.  Help spread the word!

[Contributions](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [feedback](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/issues) are welcome.

Feel free to [follow](https://www.github.com/donnemartin), [star](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz), [fork](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/fork), and check back for updates.

### How Do We Navigate Viz?

Each dashboard within `Viz` offers different levels of interactivity.  Try:

* Interacting with the filters.
* Hovering over elements to view tooltip info.
* Clicking elements to highlight or filter.

You can change the activate dashboard through the following control:

### Can We Viz Offline?

Yes, you'll need the **free** [Reader](http://www.tableau.com/products/reader).  Download and run the latest [Viz Workbook](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/tree/master/viz).  This allows you to interact with a **local copy**--you'll need to download the latest workbook as updates are continually pushed.

Depending on your setup, you'll likely see **improved performance running `Viz` locally.**

### Why Does the Online Viz Reset After Several Minutes of Inactivity?

Sessions timeout after some inactivity.  For more details, [view this post](https://community.tableau.com/thread/170831) from the Tableau Forums.

### Why Isn't the Online Interactive Viz Loading for Me?

The visualization hosting service might be having issues.  Check the [status](https://trust.tableau.com/status/tableau-public).

You can also run `Viz` offline.

### Can We See Visualizations in JavaScript, Python, R or ...?

Please check out the following [ticket](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/issues/11).

### What Data Is Tracked?

Although [GitHub Trending](https://github.com/trending) is a **great tool to discover up-and-coming projects**, it only allows you to review up to **one month** of data.  Third-party sites often show **all-time stats** that are **relatively static**, as they are dominated by well-established repos.

`Viz` is meant to supplement existing solutions by **filtering only on the newest, most popular repos** created within a specific timeframe.

***For example, `Viz` 2017 will only track repos created within the year 2017.***

### Can We See Stats for Time Ranges Other Than 2017?

`Viz` currently provides stats for 2017, 2016, 2015, and rolling 1-, 3-, and 6-months.

### Can We See Stats for 'Older' Repos?

In the future, `Viz` can be extended to track repos regardless of creation date.  Feedback on this [ticket](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/issues/9) is welcome.

### How Do You Mine Data?

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/W5hfGVo.png)

Mining data directly from GitHub, `Viz` is powered by the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and leverages the following:

* [`github3.py`](https://github.com/sigmavirus24/github3.py) to access the GitHub API through Python.
* [`pandas`](https://github.com/pydata/pandas) in the following [IPython Notebook](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/blob/master/githubstats/data_wrangling.ipynb) for data wrangling.
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/?hl=en) through [`geocoder`](https://github.com/DenisCarriere/geocoder) for location data.
* [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/s/) for visualizations.*

In the future, [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) along with [GitHub Archive](https://www.githubarchive.org/) could also supplement the GitHub API.

**Interested in visualizations with JavaScript, Python, R, or ...?  Check out the following [ticket](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/issues/11).*

### Where Do We Find the Data?

* [Data](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/tree/master/githubstats/data)
* [Data Tables](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/tree/master/language_stats)
* [Tableau Workbooks](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/tree/master/viz)

### When Did You Mine the 2017 Data?

The `Viz` 2017 stats were mined on `January 1, 2018, between 00:00 to 01:00 PDT` and include all repos created in the year 2017.  The data is preserved [here](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/tree/master/language_stats/2017_frozen).

### Why Are My 2017 Manual Search Results Different From Viz 2017?

With [GitHub Search](https://github.com/search), you can manually run queries similar to what you would get from the GitHub API.

To view the most-starred JavaScript repos created in 2017, run the following [query](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=created%3A2017-01-01..2017-12-31+stars%3A%3E%3D100+language%3Ajavascript&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults):

    created:2017-01-01..2017-12-31 stars:>=100 language:javascript

To check stats for a user's or an org's repos that were created in 2017, run:

    created:2017-01-01..2017-12-31 stars:>=100 user:user_name

*Star counts from the searches above will show data up to the time you performed the search.*

### Why Restrict Search Results to `stars:>=100` or `stars:>=500` for Viz 2017?

Only repos with `stars:>=100` are tracked to help filter GitHub's rapidly growing **49+ million** repositories and to keep within the [GitHub API rate limits](https://developer.github.com/v3/rate_limit/).

Some visualizations with additional data such as `pull requests`, `issues`, `contributors`, and `commits` filter repos with `stars:>=500`

`Viz` 6-, 3-, and 1-month might loosen this restriction as there should be less repos to analyze.  [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) along with [GitHub Archive](https://www.githubarchive.org/) could also supplement the GitHub API.

### Why Stars and Forks?

`Viz` provides stats for repos, users, and orgs by stars (and in many cases, forks).  **Stars and forks are *not* perfect metrics**, yet they are **simple and fairly effective measures of interest**.  For a more detailed discussion on measuring repo popularity, check out ["On the Popularity of GitHub Applications:
 A Preliminary Note"](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/blob/master/assets/gh-stats.pdf) which concludes:

>The number of stars of a system tends to correlate not only with the number of forks, but
also with its effective usage by other client applications, which reinforces the importance
of stars as a real measure of a systemâ€™s popularity.

#### New Support for Additional Metrics

**Update**: Viz now includes additional data such as `pull requests`, `issues`, `contributors`, and `commits`.

### How Are Stats for Users and Orgs Calculated?

To provide stats for users and orgs, `Viz` groups stars and forks by user or org.  Note the `stars:>=100` restriction still applies.

### What Languages Are Tracked?

`Viz` tracks the most popular languages on GitHub plus the `Unknown` language option.  Repo languages are identified by [github/linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist).
